            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Marco, I'm a pianist and ex-teacher who's now a wannabe front-end developer!
                 I'm very passionate about way too many things, some of these including literature, writing, cinema, tennis, videogames, psychology (I'm close to take my bachelor degree) and music.
                 The complete list would be too long, and it's a real pity life is too short to explore them all like I'd love to!
                 Programming is always been something I've been fascinated by, and eventually I started diving in this ocean with the purpose of learning a lot, becoming really good and try making a living out of it!
                 I started studying coding with Python but I soon switched to Front-end development as I realized I would have liked to start this career making websites and web apps!
                 I plan to become a good front-end developer first, then I could go back to my Python study to learn back-end too, and become a full-stack developer.
                 I'm sure this adventure will reserve me a lot of surprises and a priceless learning experience!
